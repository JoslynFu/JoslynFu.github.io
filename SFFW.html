									<h1>Strategy Consultant<br />
										at SF Fashion Week</h1>
									<p>I have witnessed SF Fashion Week’s growth from a team of 10 meeting at Starbucks to holding events with thousands of participants.

								<p>When I was a show producer in FAST (Fast and Student Trend), I had the chance to volunteer for Owen, the chief organizer of SF Fashion Week. Owen has always had the desire to make SF Fashion Week the next NY Fashion Week, but he lacks the essential resources. For instance, we had trouble finding makeup artists and hair stylists for fashion showcases because we could not fully compensate for the hours they spend. In the past, we sent out thousands of invitations on Instagram, and can hardly get some responses. Thinking from their shoes made me realize that I have to find those who do not do makeup purely to make a living. This reminds me of students like me who seek to enrich experience — students from the beauty schools. I thus emailed 20+ beauty schools and clearly explained what they can get from this opportunity — from getting hands-on experience in hair styling to networking with fashion industry people. Eventually, I heard back from Michael, the leader of the San Francisco Institute of Esthetics and Cosmetology, and he gladly invited their students to join our team. 
								</p>Due to the impact of Covid-19, Owen and I had come out with the idea of a “Project CARE Masks” to mobilize provisions of DIY masks created by local designers and distribute to minority groups such as the homeless population. I cannot wait to initiate a wave of resource exchange at Cal to invite students with creative talents to become part of this meaningful charity event.
