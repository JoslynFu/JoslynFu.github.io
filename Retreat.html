									<p>Re:treat takes care of your slightest emotions. Re:treat is a web application that enables college students to input a short description of their stress, generates a personalized 5-minute self-care practice to alleviate users’ emotional distress and connect students and their self-care experiences anonymously at the college level.

								<p> <b>Existing Solutions:</b> 
								<p>	The shift in emphasis from treating long-term mental health illnesses to the short-term safeguarding of mental health using day-to-day practices has given rise to a boom of meditation apps, online counseling, and even wellness-themed youtube channels. These easily accessible resources revolutionized the platforms students can seek help from, but at the same time pose new challenges: Many self-help services like online counseling can be time-consuming and expensive especially for college students, and there ​is a lack of a one-stop solution that we can refer to instantly as resources and research are scattered online. Our research on the existing mental health platforms shows an unfulfilled need to help users filter out what fits their need at that very moment and enable them to practice self-care guidance immediately. ​Moreover, although various mobile mental health service apps provide peer support to users in order to help them find a community, college-level students can face completely different kinds of issues if they are in different locations, pursuing different majors, or in different racial groups. There is no platform for students to learn from how their peers or seniors go through the same process as them, and how they overcome similar problems.
								<p> <b>Proposed Innovation:</b> 
								<p>	To tackle the two-part problem of choice overload and neglected daily hassles, ​we turn the
									internet into a toolbox that can help users quickly get a personalized 5-minute mental self-care routine to help them get over their mental slump at the moment. To that end, we will build a database that consists of evidence-based practices based on a series of methodologies like mindfulness or cognitive-behavioral paradigms and use machine learning to recommend self-care routines based on the user’s input.
									Building upon our minimal viable product with core features of emotional identification (a problem labeling process asking users to input their emotional experiences, sources and goals) and automatic generation process recommending self-care reflection exercises, we plan to further this product by building an anonymous sharing community that leads users to safely share their reflection doing self-care exercises, read peers’ reflection for shared or different emotional experiences, and respond with simple validation and empathy. Users can share the exercise they have completed, their struggles and thoughts before and after the exercise, as well as their personal strategy to cope with certain issues. The community will be based on campuses students are enrolled in to help build a sense of belonging and shared experiences. Users’ practice history and posts will be kept in an anonymous manner to ensure data privacy, but they will be able to save their favorite exercises and posts within their account.
								<p> <b>My Role:</b> 
								<p>	As the product manager, I leveraged user research and data analytics to identify and experiment with new product features and measurement methods. For instance, I used A/B testing to determine how many labels of emotion is optimal to generate suitable practice. I am responsible for the design of our project timeline and product roadmap. I also analyzed the data from the tracking of user actions, such as clicks and time spent per activity, to maximize the usefulness of exercise formats. Leading a cross-functional team to build a database that consists of evidence-based practices required me to collaborate with software engineers to construct a matching algorithm for exercises given the label inputs. 
								<p> Currently, we are building our new feature: an anonymous sharing community that leads users to safely share their reflection doing self-care exercises, read peers’ reflection for shared or different emotional experiences, and respond with simple validation and empathy. In addition, we are applying a natural language processing sentiment analysis model on feedback data to improve recommendations and expand and diversify the list of treatment options for each input. </p>
